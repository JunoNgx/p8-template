# Pico8 Template

My personal template for creating a game with Pico8, with premade **entity-component-system** and **finite state machine** architecture.

The folders' names are self-explanatory regarding each of the component.

## Installation and running

* Install Pico8, preferrably with environment variable.
* Simply run the `template.p8` cartridge the normal way, typically using the command line `pico8 ./template.p8`.
